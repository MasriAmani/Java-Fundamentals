Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

It will print:

Parent called
Child called

Since the Child class extends Parent class, the constructor of the Child class will call at first the default
constructor of the Parent class before executing its body.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
