Without running the code below, please tell me what it will print.

Answer:
It will print "Child called"
Here we are referring to the child class using Superclass (Parent) reference
But, if the methods are present in Parent Class, but overridden by SubClass, like in the case here with the "doSomething()" method,
it will be the overridden method that will be executed.


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
    c.doSomething();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public void doSomething()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
